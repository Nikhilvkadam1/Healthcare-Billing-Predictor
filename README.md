# Healthcare Billing Predictor

## Project Description  
This project is a machine learning-based healthcare billing predictor designed to estimate patient billing amounts accurately based on various patient and medical features. By analyzing factors such as age, gender, medical condition, admission type, insurance provider, medication, test results, and length of stay, the model predicts both the billing category (Low or High) and the estimated billing amount in currency.

## Key Features  
- Data preprocessing including handling categorical data and outliers  
- Classification models to predict billing category and select the best model based on performance metrics  
- Regression model to predict exact billing amount  
- Visualizations for exploratory data analysis and feature importance  
- Interactive prediction with user inputs  
- Helps healthcare providers improve billing accuracy and financial planning

## Business Impact  
This tool assists healthcare providers in optimizing billing processes, improving financial forecasting, and enhancing patient communication by providing quick, data-driven billing predictions.
